# OpenAI products and releases

OpenAI has quite a few product offerings, such as the following:

- ChatGPT: An AI chatbot that generates text and answers to user prompts and questions. It is trained on large data sets and simulates the experience of speaking with and listening to a human.

- DALL-E 2: This is a platform that analyzes descriptions and prompts of images that users want and generates them as described. For example, “paint a cat in Surrealist style.”

- Codex: Codex is like ChatGPT but for code. It’s trained on tons of code in different programming languages to simplify the coding process for developers.

- Whisper: Whisper is an automatic speech recognition tool that’s trained on audio data in dozens of languages so that it can transcribe and translate speech.

- Scholar: A program that supports researchers and students on AI-related projects, and sometimes financial assistance.

- OpenAI Gym: Gym is a toolkit that provides a foundation for developing reinforcement learning algorithms.

- OpenAI API: The developer platform is a suite of services, including the above, that helps build and deploy AI applications.
